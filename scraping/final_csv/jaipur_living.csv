One of a Kind Manchaha Capsule - Kaju-Katli Area Rug,"<div class=""product-overview-data"">
<p><p>Savitri's desire to be pampered has no end, and this Manchaha is evidence to it. This 2/7"" thick rug started with the traditional patterns of sharkarpada and waves, but an argument with her husband completely changed the destiny of this rug. For bringing that smile back to Savitri's face, her husband took multiple attempts by bringing Kaju-Katli, the sweet, which can be seen in the colourful lines at the centre of the rug. As you move upwards bouquets of flowers can be seen which finally convinced Savitri and helped the couple re-ignite their chemistry.</p><ul><li>Manchaha Capsule rugs are one-of-a-kind creations that are designed and woven by artisans in the most rural parts of Rajasthan, India – each one tells a story all its own. In exchange, Jaipur Living provides each artisan with a livable wage while driving important economic growth in the villages where they live and work. </li><li> Soft pastels and deep saturated hues work to strike a contemporary palette that is easy to coordinate for practical display. This traditional rug plays with pattern, rhythm, and scale to create individual vignettes that flow effortlessly from one into the next. </li><li> Manchaha rugs are made using leftover yarns for eco-friendly appeal. Kaju-Katli is a 100% wool area rug, hand-knotted from start to finish by Savitri herself. The result is truly one of a kind and truly irreplaceable. </li><li> Professional cleaning is recommended. Vacuum using a suction-only setting.</li></ul></p>

One of a Kind Manchaha Capsule - Akshu Area Rug,"<div class=""product-overview-data"">
<p><p>Named after Payal's son Akshu, this Manchaha has charted a long journey. Initially, Payal and Lado decided to make a design map on a piece of paper to determine what designs and motifs they wanted to include in their 2/7"" thick Manchaha. However, after 4-5 attempts, they decided to trust their intuition and wove motifs that came to them instinctively.</p><ul><li>Jaipur Living gives weavers a chance to plan and create a rug of their very own design with the One of a Kind Manchaha Capsule collection. This project reduces waste by utilizing leftover yarns and provides artisans with a dependable living wage. </li><li> Lado and Payal are a mother-daughter duo from Rajasthan – Lado draws from over thirty years of weaving experience and has passed this incredible wealth of knowledge to Payal.</li><li> This beautiful traditional area rug is split into halves, each with a personality all its own. One side of the rug features meandering lines and calming gradients while the other strikes an enchanting rhythm of small geometric motifs. Use to enliven any space with irresistible and unexpected hues. </li><li> Hand-knotted construction gives this rug a uniquely expressive aesthetic that can be appreciated in every detail. This is a blended rug made from 50% premium quality wool and 50% silky viscose, resulting in a plush pile with a radiant sheen. An airy fringe caps each end.</li><li> Place in a dry and stable environment. Because this rug is the only one of its kind and truly irreplaceable, professional cleaning is recommended.</li></ul></p>

One of a Kind Manchaha Capsule - Keri Area Rug,"<div class=""product-overview-data"">
<p><p>Keri translates to raw mango and is how Mamta explains the name of her rug. She has woven a route from her home to a tree in her village which grows raw mangoes and is her favorite summer delight. The route goes through a thin lane that zig-zags and bends, and vehicles struggle to reach there. Many of her weaver friends suggested to weave this route in her Manchaha, represented by blue, white, pink zig-zag lines towards the top of the rug. She also tried to reflect her own personality through the rug. Mamta is an extremely sweet person but has a little sourness when she's pushed or forced to talk or do something, using small and big pixels towards the bottom of the rug to represent her personality.</p><ul><li>Jaipur Living has collaborated with artisan weavers in India to create the Manchaha Capsule collection – a series of one-off, one-of-a-kind rugs where the weaver has artistic freedom. In exchange, the Jaipur Living Foundation provides a reliable wage and opportunities for personal and professional development. </li><li> Keri features a whimsical array of comforting colors, each tone subdued on its own but filled with energy as a complete composition. Traditional rug motifs are peppered throughout while bold geometric details center the eye.</li><li> This blended area rug is crafted with 50% wool and 50% bamboo viscose. It is completely hand-knotted, a true one-of-a-kind work of art sure that carries a fascinating story in every yarn. </li><li> Because this area rug is one-of-a-kind and truly irreplaceable, invest in professional cleaning as needed.</li></ul></p>
